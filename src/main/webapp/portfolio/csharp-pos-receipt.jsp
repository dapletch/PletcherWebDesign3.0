<p>During the course of the Fall 2014 Semester we were assigned to create a point of sale console application. In order
    to complete the assignment we had certain requirements which are listed as follows: display the cashier information,
    provide a header and footer, perform the actual calculation based on number of inventory stored in a series of
    arrays, and finally write the data to a text file. During the course of the semester we wrote the application line
    by line, and were then assigned to create a series of methods to be able to tackle the tasks listed above. This
    project took time and patience, but with the help of my fellow classmates, and instructor I was able to rise up to
    the challenge.</p>
