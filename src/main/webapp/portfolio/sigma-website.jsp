<p>I was the treasurer, alumni correspondent, and web administrator, for the Beta Chapter at Castleton State College. I
    pledged in the first semester of my freshman year, and the skills I learned in terms of being a member really helped
    me excel, socially, and professionally, as well.</p>
<p>I was not assigned to create the website, I created it on my free will. I realized that having your own domain name
    and hosting is essential in the any business model. As an alumni once said, "A fraternity is a business." Needless
    to say, I took that saying to heart. I decided to apply the skills I had learned to create a website, for the
    fraternity.</p>

<p>I created a a series of static HTML pages, while using CSS to add the look and feel I wanted. The website originally
    was just that, a series of static HTML pages. As my education progressed I learned more about PHP and MySQL. I
    figured I would set up the brothers for the future. I created a database to store all the contact information so
    that alumni and brothers would be able to get in touch with one another at any time.</p>

<p>It was then we started throwing parties at Rutland's only night club, The Local. It was then I installed WordPress as
    a subdirectory so the fraternity would have its very own blog. I created a series of post on behalf of the
    fraternity to increase the effectiveness of our marketing campaign. The brothers and I would then post the links for
    the blog posts all over Facebook and other social media platforms to spread the word, while passing out fliers out
    on campus. By boosting our marketing campaign the money we able to generate increased dramatically, as well as our
    donations to local charities, especially the Make A Wish Foundation.</p>
