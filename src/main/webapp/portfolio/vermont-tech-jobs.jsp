    <meta name="description" content="While taking the Technical Project Management class at Castleton University
    I was assigned to create a proof of concept for the Vermont Tech Jobs website.
    It was during this time that I learned what it was like to work on development team.
    By dividing the tasks to compliment our skill sets I was able to determine I really had a nack for web design.">

<p>I helped with the creation of this website along with my team using a combination of the Agile, and PMBOK
    methodologies. We used a combination of Sublime Text, and Brackets IDE's to be able to code and implement the
    website. We created the website using two week iterations. We were required to record our progress through the use
    of GANTT, and Burn Down Charts. Keeping track of our progess was critical to the success of the project.</p>

<p>Our group then decided to divide ourselves, in accordance to our skill sets. Two of the members were experienced with
    databases, and the other two, including myself were responsible for the creation of the actual site itself. We
    originally attempted to import an HTML template into Open Classifieds, a free open source Ad Management System, with
    little success. We decided to run with the original template and create a series of forms that would be able to
    submit data to a MySQL database. This was my first real experience with working PHP scripting. It took numerous
    hours to figure out how the PHP scripts worked and configure them to send the data as string variables, as a
    security precaution to avoid SQL Injection.</p>
<p>The experience of creating the website really enhanced my skills of HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The experiences gained
    from undertaking this project really have enhanced my, and my fellow team members knowledge of web development and
    design.</p>
