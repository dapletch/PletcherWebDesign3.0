            <p>I was the treasurer, alumni correspondent, and web administrator, for the Beta Chapter at Castleton State
                College. I pledged in the first semester of my freshman year, and the skills I learned in terms of being
                a member
                really helped me excel, socially, and professionally, as well...</p>

            <p>I helped with the creation of this website along with my team using a combination of the Agile, and PMBOK
                methodologies. We used a combination of Sublime Text, and Brackets IDE's to be able to code and
                implement the website. We created the website using two week iterations...</p>

            <p>I worked for a small start up company, by the name of Skin and Tonic. Skin and Tonic is owned and
                operated by, Charlene Palfey. Skin and Tonic sells homemade homeopathic skin care products that are
                derived from ingredients that she personally grows in her back yard. She enlisted my services to help her in the
                creation of a WordPress website...</p>

            <p>This is a basic prototype that I created for the Mobile Apps Class at Castleton State College. I created
                the app to be cross platform. The IDE that I used was Intel XDK. The IDE also integrated one of my other
                favorite IDE's, Brackets, to be able to perform the actual coding. Intel XDK, also offered a user
                friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI)...</p>

            <p>During the course of the Fall 2014 Semester we were assigned to create a point of sale console
                application. In order to complete the assignment we had certain requirements which are listed as
                follows: display the cashier information, provide a header and footer, perform the actual calculation based on number of inventory
                stored in a series of arrays, and finally write the data to a text file...</p>

            <p>Part of being a successful web developer is understanding web analytics. I was assigned this assignment,
                as a tool to better understanding HashMaps and ArrayLists. After I had completed this assignment I
                gained a significant amount of knowledge especially in regard to regular expressions...</p>
