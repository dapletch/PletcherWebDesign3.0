<p>I worked for a small start up company, by the name of Skin and Tonic. Skin and Tonic is owned and operated by,
    Charlene Palfey. Skin and Tonic sells homemade homeopathic skin care products that are derived from ingredients that
    she personally grows in her back yard. She enlisted my services to help her in the creation of a WordPress website.
    The images you see above are some wire-frames and images development, for said website. Needless to say, ever since
    I helped her get her site up and running her sales have increased dramatically. You can check out the actual site by
    going to <a href="http://skinandtonic.care/">skinandtonic.care</a>.</p>
<p>I primarily use WordPress, for my clientele, and have written up some simple documentation that is easy to follow and
    would help anyone in maintaining their own WordPress website.</p>
