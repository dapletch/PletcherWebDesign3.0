<p>This is a basic prototype that I created for the Mobile Apps Class at Castleton State College. I created the app to
    be cross platform. The IDE that I used was Intel XDK. The IDE also integrated one of my other favorite IDE's,
    Brackets, to be able to perform the actual coding. Intel XDK, also offered a user friendly Graphical User Interface
    (GUI), to be able to click and drag certain elements, which allowed for Rapid Application Development (RAD). By
    using a combination of the Agile and RAD methodologies was able to create a functional user friendly app that was
    cross platform. This was also the first instance I ever created a successful login script by using HTML, CSS, PHP,
    and MySQL. The skills I learned while creating this app are essential for any web developer who is preparing to
    enter the field of web design and development.</p>
