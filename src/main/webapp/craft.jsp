            <p>The web has evolved so quickly since it was first developed back in the late 80's that developers often
                times concentrate on technical efficiency rather than aesthetic value. This means that most websites can
                perform complex tasks, but fail to catch the eye of the user.</p>

            <p>When I design media for the web, I first thoroughly research the subject that I am designing for. I
                utilize a plethora the free open source image editing technologies that make images look aesthetically
                pleasing to the eye. Websites need to have an excellent graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a
                rich texture, depth, custom buttons, borders, and backgrounds. I custom code the websites features that
                go on every page, by using a HTML5, JavaScript, CSS 2 &amp; 3, PHP, and Java where applicable.</p>

                 style="padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;">
            <p>I primarily use WordPress, for most of my clientele, but I not opposed to looking into new solutions that
                would be able to better suit the needs of the client. I am also able to able to custom code templates,
                by using HTML in conjunction with CSS to be able to render any site with the desired look and feel.
                Believe or not the site you are currently looking at was custom coded using the HTML, CSS, Java, and
                Java Servlet Pages (JSP's).</p>
            <img src="images/brackets_preview.jpg" height="150px" width="150px" align="left" alt="brackets"
                 style="padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;">
            <p>The tools I use are Brackets, IntelliJ Ultimate Edition, to custom code the look, and feel, of the
                websites I develop. Before any coding begins I create a series of wire-frames that are simple and easy
                to understand. That way the web pages that I are neat and uniform and fulfill the purpose for the which
                they were created. Providing quality content and features is quintessential to the development of any
                website. <img src="images/intellijidea-logo.png" height="200px" width="200px" align="right"
                              alt="IntelliJ" style="padding-left: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;">The code that is generated
                is always clean, efficient, and up-to-date on the most current standards. When it comes to maintenance I
                make sure that all changes that I perform to any website work in a development environment before being
                moved to production, that way what is live in production is mirrored in development.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>I primarily use GIMP, as my image editing sofware of choice. The software solutions I choose are usually
                free open source software solutions. I do what I can, when I can to reduce costs, which ultimately
                reduces the end cost for my clients as well.</p>
            <p>I have experience in using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, as well. I have explored a
                multitude of different software solutions to be able to perform simple business applications. It is
                through this thorough analysis that allows me to better guide clients to more effective and efficient
                business practices.</p>
