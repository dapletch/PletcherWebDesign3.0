	<p> When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, 
		and when toast is dropped, it always lands with the 
		buttered side down. I propose to strap buttered toast
		to the back of a cat; the two will hover, inches above 
		the ground. With a giant buttered-cat array, a 
		high-speed monorail could easily link New York with
		Chicago.
