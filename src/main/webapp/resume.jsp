            Worked on Java Web Applications while using the Struts2 web framework, and Java Servlet Pages
            (JSP's) to create dynamic web pages that members would use to access the 30 million plus records of
            genomic data that the Association possesses. Generated reports from running queries against the
            Informix database, while creating solutions to generate and display said reports on the website.
            Created Bash, and Korn scripts to run on the back-end on an HP-UX server for the purposes of
            reporting, and server maintenance. Would perform maintenance and analytics on the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
            web server that hosted the Holstein USA webapp. Created a java application that was capable of
            reading and parsing both Apace Tomcat, and Apache2 access logs, that would submit the records to a
            MySQL database to better determine how much traffic was coming through the
            <a href="http://www.holsteinusa.com/">http://www.holsteinusa.com/</a> website. By having access
            to this information I was better able to determine when to perform maintenance, and system upgrades.

            Utilized WordPress as a Content Management System (CMS) to develop and launch an e-commerce website,

            sold through through Etsy, a third party site for small time arts and crafts connoisseurs, by
            utilizing Etsy's WordPress plugin I was able to display the products onto site.

            Made and created all website pages in HTML while utilizing JavaScript, and PHP, for more dynamic
            features. Continually updated and revised pages for content while performing maintenance. Also
            linked the fraternity's PayPal account to the site to make it easier for alumni to make donations to
            the fraternity, by implementing PayPal directly into the site the fraternity was able to receive
            thousands of dollars of revenue just from donations alone. Incorporated WordPress as a sub-directory
            so the fraternity would be able to utilize a Content Management System, which was used in
            conjunction with Facebook to perform an online marketing campaign to generate thousands of dollars
            of revenue for charitable donations i.e. Make a Wish Foundation, and the local Castleton Food Shelf.
