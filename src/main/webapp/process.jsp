            <p>When you think about it almost anything can be thought about as a system. The term system is broad and
                general term,
                so how do we define it then? The true definition of a system is a set of interdependent components
                forming
                an
                integrated whole. It's a term that can be used in different industries, including, but not limited to
                web
                design. We
                take this methodology to heart, for it is these steps that we follow to design and implement beautifully
                crafted
                websites. The first stage of getting any website up and running is Planning.</p>
            <h2 id="Planning">Planning</h2>
            <p>The Planning phase is the most crucial step in creating a successful system, during this phase you decide
                exactly
                what you want to do and the problems you're trying to solve, by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining the problems, the objectives and the resources available i.e. content, images, video,
                    etc.
                </li>
                <li>Studying the ability of proposing alternative solutions after initial meeting.</li>
                <li>Studying how to market your products better than your competitors. After analyzing these scenarios
                    you
                    will have
                    two choices: develop a new system, or improve the current one.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="Analysis">Analysis</h2>
            <p>The client's requirements should be determined and documented, what their expectations are for the
                system,
                and how it
                will perform. A feasibility study will be made for the project as well, involving determining whether
                it's
                organizationally, economically, socially, technologically feasible. It's very important to us to
                maintain
                strong
                communication level with you, the client, to make sure you have a clear vision of the finished product
                and
                its
                function.</p>
            <h2 id="Design">Design</h2>
            <img src="images/home_page.png" width="218px" height="223px" name="image_name" align="left"
                 style="padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;"
                 onmouseover="image_name.width='419';image_name.height='429';"
                 onmouseout="image_name.width='218';image_name.height='223';"/>
            <p>The design phase comes after a solid understanding of customer's requirements, this phase defines the
                elements of a
                system, the components, the security level, modules, architeture and the different interfaces and type
                of
                data that
                goes through the system. A general system is implemented by the use of wire-framing solutions, and
                through
                detailed
                documentation. The wire-frames that are provided to clients are easy to follow and understand. It is
                with
                these
                tools that the system will be designed and implemented, so that it will meet all functional and
                technical
                requirements, logically and physically.</p>
            <h2 id="Implementation">Implementation &amp; Deployment</h2>
            <p>This phase comes after a complete understanding of system requirements and specifications, it's the
                actual
                construction process after having a complete understanding and illustrated design for the requested
                system.
                In the
                Software Development Life Cycle, the actual code is written here. In this phase, the system is ready to
                be
                deployed
                and installed on the server along with being attached to the desired domain name.</p>

                    style="padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;">Training may be required for end users to make
                sure
                they know
                how to the system and to get familiar with it, the implementation phase may take a some time, but that
                depends on
                the complexity of the system and the solution it presents. It is by taking these basic design
                principles,
                that
                rigorous testing must be performed, through the process of agile development. When a feature is
                completed it
                is
                testing to the fullest extent of its ability, so that will be able to function properly when it is
                launched
                into
                development.</p>
            <h2 id="Maintenance">Maintenance</h2>
            <p>In this phase, periodic maintenance for the sytem will be carried out to make sure that the system won't
                become
                obsolete, this includes replacing old features with updated ones, rewriting content, or changing of a
                market
                strategy. By building the system in short iterations; we can guarantee meeting the customer's
                requirements
                before we
                build the whole system.</p>
