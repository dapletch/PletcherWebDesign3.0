            <p>I first delved into the world of web design by taking a Web Development, as a dual enrollment class,
                during my senior year at Brattleboro Union High School. Needless to say, I fell in love. As the semester
                progressed, so did my skills in web design. I later took those skills and applied through out my college
                career, while attending Castleton University in the Computer Information Systems (CIS) program.</p>

            <p>While in college I created two websites that later went live. The first website that I created was the
                local Sigma Delta Chi Fraternity. The fraternityâ€™s website started out as a series of static HTML pages
                that only provided information about the fraternity, and nothing more. As time progressed, I added some
                JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, for more dynamic features. The MySQL database that I created has helped
                countless alumni reconnect with one another. I also worked along side with the acting treasurer at the
                time to set up a PayPal account. Once the PayPal account was all set up and launched on the website,
                thousands of dollars of donations starting coming through, but I didn't stop there.</p>

                 style="padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;">
            <p>I then added WordPress as a sub directory, so the fraternity would have it's own blog. After WordPress
                was successfully installed the fraternity was able to launch a massive online marketing campaign for
                their parties, and other social events that they were hosting. This enhanced ability to market
                themselves allowed them to raise $600 for the Make a Wish Foundation. You can see my work at
                <a href="http://www.sigmadeltachicsc.com/">sigmadeltachicsc.com</a>.</p>

                 style="padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 2px;">
            <p>The second website that I created while enrolled in an internship, for the start up skin care company,
                Skin and Tonic. I met with the owner, Charlene Palfey, and came up with a plan to use WordPress as the
                content management system to be able to create the site. I searched for templates and gave her list of
                options that I thought would be able to suit her needs. After some time and consideration, we finally
                found a template that would give her site the look and feel a real care company. I manipulated the
                template to incorporate the graphical content that she had previously acquired, through Green Screen
                Graphics in Rutland, VT. Once I had all the content creating the website was a breeze. I then consulted
                Charlene to hash out the final details, for the domain and hosting, and came up with <a
                        href="http://www.skinandtonic.care/">skinandtonic.care</a>, as the domain name.</p>
